# Je Suis Là

("I'm here" in English, pronounced /ʒə sɥi la/)

Je Suis Là is a simple library powered by OpenLayers and OpenStreetMaps. Its main goal is to quickly generate a map with a fixed pointer, without having to study Geolocation. It's useful for customers who wants a map with their company's location pinned. It's free and you just have to indicate the latitude and longitude (you can easily find those values on OpenStreetMaps in the url bar).
